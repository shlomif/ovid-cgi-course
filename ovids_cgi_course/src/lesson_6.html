<h1>Easy CGI Programs</h1>

<p>In this lesson, we're actually going to start writing a few CGI programs.  In
fact, we're just going to have a bit of fun by presenting you with two small
programs in the hopes that you'll start to get a feel for how CGI programming
in Perl works and, more importantly, to give you a bit of satisfaction that
you're actually <em>doing</em> something.  One of the programs will use
CGI.pm's HTML generating functions and the other one will use here-documents to
embed the HTML.  This will give you the opportunity to feel comfortable with
both styles.</p>

<p>Let's start out by creating a little CGI template upon which you'll build
your other programs.</p>

<div class="program"><pre> 1  #!/usr/local/bin/perl -T
 2  use strict;
 3  use warnings;
 4  use CGI qw/:standard/;
 5
 6  use constant TITLE =&gt; 'Template for Programs';
 7
 8  print
 9      header,
10      start_html(-title =&gt; TITLE),
11      h1(TITLE),
12      hr,
13      p("Here's where the content will go"),
14      hr,
15      end_html;</pre></div>

<p>We'll go ahead and use the CGI.pm HTML generating functions because they
generate valid XHTML (thus freeing us from worrying about why our page won't
render) and because it's much cleaner style.  Those functions, by the way,
generate the XHTML semantically equivalent to the following:</p>

<div class="program"><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html
        PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Template for Programs&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Template for Programs&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's where the content will go&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre></div>

<p>This template will prove useful as we later want to create another small
program and have the shell in place for us.  Of course, when programming real
systems for a business, you'll rarely see something so simplistic, but
it can be fun to get back to the "good ol' days" of the web, when
stuff like this was cutting edge.</p>

<h3>Dice Rolling for Dummies</h3>

<p>For our first program, let's roll some dice.
Perhaps you're familiar with some sort of role-playing game such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_and_dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>.
These games often have dice with many different sides: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20-sided dice are the most common.
They are used to generate random numbers with certain simple distributions.
To see if you could hit an enemy with your sword, you might roll a 20-sided dice once.
To generate statistics for your character (such as strength, intelligence, etc.,) you might have to roll two 10-sided dice or three 6-sided dice.
Let's write a short program to do that.
</p>

<div class="notice"><p><strong>Debugging tips</strong></p>
<p>Don't forget: if you get an "Internal Server Error"
and can't figure out what is wrong, you can add the following line
to your code:</p>

<div class="program"><pre>use CGI::Carp qw/fatalsToBrowser/;</pre></div>

<p>That <em>should</em> show the error in the browser. Don't forget
to remove it for production!</p>

<p>Also, you can test from the command line whether or not your program
compiles.</p>

<div class="program"><pre>perl -Tc <em>myprog.pl</em></pre></div>

<p>The <tt>T</tt> switch is needed to have Perl launch with taint checking
enabled and the <tt>c</tt> switch tells Perl to only compile the program,
don't run it.  However, any code in <tt>BEGIN {}</tt> blocks will still be
run, but that's beyond the scope of this tutorial.</p>

<p>As a final note, if you have Perl 5.8 or above, you can use the "little t"
switch.  This switch merely warns about taint violations, it does not kill the
program.  This is useful when you're trying to convert older programs over to
taint mode.</p></div>

<p>First, we want the form:</p>

<div class="html_output"><table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td>Number of rolls: </td>

        <td><input name="rolls" type="text"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Number of sides: </td>
        <td><input name="sides" type="text"></td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<input value="Roll!" type="submit"></div>

<p class="notice">Whenever you need a quick refresher on CGI.pm's HTML generating functions, you can refer to
<a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node=mod://CGI">the CGI.pm documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The code for the form looks something like this:</p>

<div class="program"><pre>print start_form,
  table(
    Tr([
        td(['Number of rolls: ', textfield(-name =&gt; 'rolls')]),
    ]),
    Tr([
        td(['Number of sides: ', textfield(-name =&gt; 'sides')]),
    ]),
  ),
  submit(-value =&gt; 'Roll!'),
end_form;</pre></div>

<p>We might roll one die with X sides like this:</p>

<div class="program"><pre>sub roll {
    my $sides = shift;
    return int(rand($sides)) + 1;
}</pre></div>

<p>And to roll several of them, we can wrap this in another function:</p>

<div class="program"><pre>sub roll_dice {
    my ($rolls, $sides) = @_;
    my $total = 0;
    $total += roll($sides) for 1 .. $rolls;
    return $total;
}</pre></div>

<p>Putting that all together with some code to read the form data gives us the
following:</p>

<div class="program"><pre> 1  #!/usr/local/bin/perl -Tw
 2  use strict;
 3  use CGI::Pretty qw/:standard/;
 4
 5  use constant TITLE =&gt; 'Dice Rolling';
 6  my $_rolls = param('rolls');
 7  my $_sides = param('sides');
 8
 9  my ($rolls) = $_rolls =~ /^(\d+)$/;
10  my ($sides) = $_sides =~ /^(\d+)$/;
11
12  my $show_result = '';
13
14  if ($rolls &amp;&amp; $sides) {
15      my $result = roll_dice($rolls, $sides);
16      $show_result = p("${rolls}d${sides} result: $result");
17  }
18
19  sub roll_dice {
20      my ($rolls, $sides) = @_;
21      my $total = 0;
22      $total += roll($sides) for 1 .. $rolls;
23      return $total;
24  }
25
26  sub roll {
27      my $sides = shift;
28      return int(rand($sides)) + 1;
29  }
30
31  print
32      header,
33      start_html(-title =&gt; TITLE),
34        h1(TITLE),
35        hr,
36        $show_result,
37        start_form,
38          table(
39            Tr([
40                td(['Number of rolls: ', textfield(-name =&gt; 'rolls')]),
41            ]),
42            Tr([
43                td(['Number of sides: ', textfield(-name =&gt; 'sides')]),
44            ]),
45          ),
46          submit(-value =&gt; 'Roll!'),
47        end_form,
48        hr,
49      end_html;</pre></div>

<p>Now go ahead and try running that program and see what it does.</p>

<h3>RPG Character Generation</h3>

<p>Many of us used to (or still do) play role playing games (RPGs).  In these
games, you used paper and dice and imagination and potato chips and soda to
create an imaginary world where your characters could do everything you really
want to do now but would get slapped, arrested or killed if you actually tried
it.  In these games, you played a "character" and this character would have
some basic information called "stats" which tracked such things as how strong
they were, how healthy, etc.</p>

<p>For the next program, we'll go ahead and roll some stats for different
species ("races", in RPG lingo) of characters: humans, elves, and dwarves.
We'll also use the more common here-document syntax.
It's messier, but it's also easier to see what's going on.
</p>

<p>First, we'll go ahead and reuse the <tt>roll()</tt> and
<tt>roll_dice()</tt> subroutines from the previous program.
In the real world, you'd probably want to
move these into their own package, for proper code reuse. Read
<a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node=doc://perlmod">the <tt>perlmod</tt> documentation</a>
or Mark Jason Dominus'
<a href="http://perl.plover.com/Hello/">very, very short tutorial about modules in Perl</a>,
if you're interested in learning more about this.
</p>

<p>First, we'll create some constants representing the various attributes
a character can posses.</p>

<div class="program"><pre>use constant STR =&gt; 0;
use constant INT =&gt; 1;
use constant WIS =&gt; 2;
use constant CON =&gt; 3;
use constant DEX =&gt; 4;
use constant CHA =&gt; 5;</pre></div>

<p>We'll use those constants later when we index into the array listing
the attributes:</p>

<div class="program"><pre>my @stats = qw/
    Strength
    Intelligence
    Wisdom
    Constitution
    Dexterity
    Charisma
/;</pre></div>

<p class="notice">We're about to start using complex data structure.  In this
case, it's a hash of hashes (or  "HoH" for short).  If you're not
familiar with complex data structures, read
<a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node=doc://perlreftut">the <tt>perlreftut</tt> documentation</a>
to see how these work.  It's difficult to get real work done in Perl without
them.</p>

<p>Next, we'll define the three races.  In role-playing games, when characters
are first generated, their various statistics are often adjusted up or down
based upon the race's natural abilities.  We'll refer to this as the "stat
adjustment".  Let's create a data structure which will let us keep track of these
abilities.</p>

<div class="program"><pre>my %races = (
    human =&gt; {},
    elf   =&gt; {
        DEX, +1,
        INT, -1
    },
    dwarf =&gt; {
        STR, +1,
        WIS, -1
    },
);</pre></div>

<p>Now if you've been programming Perl for a while, this may look a bit
strange.  We have a hash of races with each race pointing to a hash of
attributes.  However, you're probably used to seeing something like this:</p>

<div class="program"><pre>my %races = (
    human =&gt; {},
    elf   =&gt; {
        DEX =&gt; +1,
        INT =&gt; -1
    },
    dwarf =&gt; {
        STR =&gt; +1,
        WIS =&gt; -1
    }
);</pre></div>

<p>The reason we use a normal comma (,) instead of the so-called "fat comma"
(=&gt;) is because the fat comma automagically quotes whatever is on the left
(if it can).  We don't want the keys treated as strings.  Instead, we want the
keys to be the numeric values represented by the constants.  We'll see why in a
bit, but first, let's look at the dropdown we'll create for the form.  This
drop down lets the person choose which race of character they wish to
create.</p>

<div class="program"><pre> 1  my $dropdown = make_dropdown(%races);
 2
03  sub make_dropdown {
04      my %races = @_;
05      my $options = "";
06      foreach my $race (keys %races) {
07          my $label = ucfirst $race;
08          $options .= qq|  &lt;option value="$race"&gt;$label&lt;/option&gt;\n|;
09      }
10      my $select = qq|&lt;select name="race"&gt;$options&lt;/select&gt;\n|;
11      return $select;
12  }</pre></div>

<p>When that runs, <tt>$dropdown</tt> will have a value similar to this:</p>

<div class="program"><pre>&lt;select name="race"&gt;
  &lt;option value="human"&gt;Human&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value="elf"&gt;Elf&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value="dwarf"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;</pre></div>

<p>That one is pretty simple.  We merely iterate over the keys in the hash
(line 06) and we make the first character upper-case (line 07) for the value
the user will see in the form and we'll make the key the value which gets sent
back to the server.</p>

<p>Generating the character will be a bit more difficult, though, so let's look
at this closely.  Here will see why we wanted the numeric keys in the
<tt>%races</tt> hash.</p>

<div class="program"><pre> 1  my $character = generate_character(\@stats, \%races);
 2
 3  sub generate_character {
 4      my ($stats, $races) = @_;
 5      my $_race  = param('race');
 6      my ($race) = $_race =~ /^(\w+)$/; # untaint it
 7      return '' unless exists $races-&gt;{$race};
 8      my $this_race = $races-&gt;{$race};
 9      my $rows = '';
10      foreach my $stat_index (0 .. $#$stats) {
11          my $label = $stats-&gt;[$stat_index];
12          my $roll  = roll_dice(3,6);
13          if (exists $this_race-&gt;{$stat_index}) {
14              $roll += $this_race-&gt;{$stat_index};
15          }
16          $rows .= &lt;&lt;END_ROW;
17        &lt;tr&gt;
18          &lt;td&gt;$label: &lt;/td&gt;
19          &lt;td&gt;$roll&lt;/td&gt;
20        &lt;/tr&gt;
21  END_ROW
22      }
23      my $desription = "&lt;p&gt;Stats for a $race&lt;/p&gt;\n";
24      my $table = "$description&lt;table&gt;$rows&lt;/table&gt;";
25      return $table;
26  }</pre></div>

<p>This subroutine is doing quite a bit.  In lines 4 through 6, we see that
we're fetching the value of 'race' which is supplied via the drop-down on the
page.  In reality, we don't need to untaint 'race' here as we're not doing
anything unsafe with it, but it's better to be too cautious than not cautious
enough.</p>

<p>In line 8, we go ahead and fetch the appropriate race from the
<tt>%races</tt> hash.  This is not strictly necessary, but if we didn't, lines
13 and 14 would look even messier:</p>

<div class="program"><pre>13          if (exists $races-&gt;{$race}{$stat_index}) {
14              $roll += $races-&gt;{$race}{$stat_index};
15          }</pre></div>

<p>On line 10, we start iterating over the <em>indexes</em> of the stats, not
the stats themselves.  The reason we do this is each race has a hashref where
we can determine the "stat adjustment" by doing a hash lookup on the stat
index.  In line 14, we can see that offset has been added to the die roll.</p>

<p>Lines 16 through 20 are where we build up the table row and line 24 has
us creating the actual table.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that we're doing three things in this one subroutine:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We're fetching and validating the race.</li>
  <li>We're generating the character stats.</li>
  <li>We're building a table.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a general rule it's considered bad style to have a subroutine try to do
too many things.  In fact, the subroutine has deliberately been left this way
because exercise two for this lesson shows why this is a bad thing, but we'll
get to that later.</p>

<p>Now that we have all of our building blocks in place, let's go ahead and put
them together.</p>

<div class="program"><pre>  1 #!/usr/local/bin/perl -Tw

<p>That's a lot of typing, but the payoff is worth it.  You'll understand a lot
more about basic CGI programming by going through it.  You'll note that up
through line 33, we are primarily declaring the data we will use throughout the
program.  Lines 61 and beyond are the subroutines we will use.  The actual
"work" is done on lines 34 through 38:  making the drop down, generating the
character and printing the document.  Further, you'll notice that the
subroutines are all little black boxes.  If you feed them the right data,
they'll give the right responses, no matter where they are placed.  This makes
it easy to reuse them elsewhere (preferably as part of a module so they only
need to be written once.)</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<ol>

<li>In the dice rolling program, what happens if you enter a zero for either
the number of rolls or number of sides?  Why?  What happens if you enter
anything that is not a positive integer?</li>

<li>After playing with the character generation program for a while, you start
to get annoyed that if the race you're generating a character for is not the
first one in the drop-down, you have to reselect it every time.  Modify the
program so it "remembers" which race you chose last.</li>

<li>Now that you've changed the program so the drop-down remembers which race
you selected last, modify it so the actual generating of the HTML is in its own
subroutine.  You'll want the core of the program to look like this:

<div class="program"><pre>my $dropdown  = make_dropdown(%races);
my $character = generate_character(\@stats, \%races);
my $html      = html_doc($title, $dropdown, $character);

print header, $html;

sub html_doc {
    my ($title, $form, $result) = @_;
    ...</pre></div></li>

</ol>

<p>Hints for exercise 2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move the <tt>param()</tt> function and the untainting code into
  its own subroutine.</li>
  <li>You can force a select list to have a particular item chosen by setting
  the "selected" attribute on an option:
  <div class="program"><pre>&lt;option value="elf" selected="selected"&gt;Elf&lt;/option&gt;</pre></div>
  </li>
</ul>

Cookies are poorly understood so let's take a bit of time to understand what
cookies are and examine some of the implications of poor cookie management.
We're going to spend a fair amount of time on how cookies are implemented and
the security implications of this because it's very important that you
understand what is going on.  Cookies are very, very easy to get wrong.</p>

<p>As you know by this point in the course, HTTP is what is known as a
<em>stateless</em> protocol.  This means that each request is completely
independent of other requests.  The server handling the requests really has no
way of knowing if the request coming in is a follow-up on a previous request.
That's kind of like clicking "save" in a program and not having the program
know what it's supposed to be saving.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt?number=2109">RFC 2109</a>,
an HTTP State Management Mechanism based on two new headers, <tt>Cookie</tt>
and <tt>Set-Cookie</tt>, was introduced (and this was in turn based on an
earlier Netscape proposal which is why you sometimes still hear the term
"Netscape Magic Cookie".)  These two headers allowed the user-agent (again
referreed to as browser for the rest of the lesson) and server to exchange a
bit of text which carried state information.  This has been both a blessing and
a curse.</p>

<p>In simpler terms, this just means that when you log into a web site, it now
has a way of "remembering" who you are.  Now let's look at the actual header
before we consider the security implications.</p>

<p>Only servers set cookies.  The header line looks something like this (see
the RFC for far more information than you ever wanted to know):</p>

<div class="program"><pre>Set-Cookie: <em>name</em>=<em>value</em>; expires=<em>date</em>; domain=<em>domain</em>; path=<em>path</em>; secure</pre></div>

<p>The <em>emphasized</em> items are the values that change.  Let's take a look
at these:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Name/Value</dt>
  <dd>The name and value of the cookie.  All other items are optional.</dd>
  <dt><tt>expires</tt></dt>
  <dd>The expiration date of the cookie.  The cookie will not be sent after this date.</dd>
  <dt><tt>domain</tt></dt>
  <dd>The domain to which the cookie will be sent.  Must start with a dot and
  contain at least two dots (e.g., <tt>.example.com</tt>) to prevent someone
  setting a cookie for the <tt>.com</tt> domain.</dd>
  <dt><tt>path</tt></dt>
  <dd>The path on the domain for which the cookie may be returned.</dd>
  <dt><tt>secure</tt></dt>
  <dd>Whether or not the cookie is required to be sent over a secure connection.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Once the server send a cookie, the client receives it and probably stores
it.  (For security reasons, there are several cases where the client may refuse
to store a cookie.  Please see the RFC.)  The location of where it's stored
varies quite a bit depending upon the browser.  When the browser visits the
domain again, it consults its cookie and if it finds a cookie which matches the
domain, the path, and is before the expiration date, it returns the cookie
(there's more, but those are the high points.)</p>

<div class="program"><pre>Cookie: <em>name</em>=<em>value</em>; <em>name</em>=<em>value</em>;...</pre></div>

<p>You'll note that there is more than one name/value pair in this example.
This is because a server may set more than one cookie at a time.  However,
because browsers are not required to store more than 300 cookies, this is
considered bad manners as cookies which are not used as frequently will get
bumped when you exceed your cookie limit.  This is why those who surf the web
heavily often find that sites they thought they had logged into have forgotten
them.</p>

<p>Once the server receives the cookie(s) from the browser, it can use the
name/value combinations to determine who the browser is.  So let's see how this
is typically handled.  First, you visit the web site and the server (or more
likely some process running on the server) sees that you don't have a cookie, so
it creates a difficult-to-guess ID which is set in a cookie
(broken over two lines for readability):</p>

<div class="program"><pre>Set-Cookie our_user=6a204bd89f3c8348afd5c77c717a097;
expires=Friday, 01-Jan-06 00:00:00 GMT; path=/;</pre></div>

<p>Since the domain was not specified, it defaults to the host/domain of the
server.  When the user returns, her browser sends back the following
cookie:</p>

<div class="program"><pre>Cookie: our_user=6a204bd89f3c8348afd5c77c717a097;</pre></div>

<p>Now the server looks up the ID and sees that this user was here before.  The
value might be a key in a database table which also tells the user preferences,
where on the site the user has been or other information which those running the
server wish to maintain.</p>

<h2>The Dangers</h2>

<p class="security"><img src="file:///home/shlomif/OVID_CGI/web.archive.org/web/20100824075447im_/http:/jdporter.perlmonk.org/cgi_course/checkpoint.gif" alt="Security Checkpoint" align="left" border="0" width="26" height="28">

Now that you have a rough idea of how cookies work, here are some horror
stories for you.  They are all true.</p>

<p>Anecdote 1:  a rather large, well-known company decided to create a web portal
where people could log in and save their personal data.  Unfortunately, this
company decided that the value they would send in the cookie would be a number
which was incremented by 1 (one) each time.  Thus, subsequent cookies would look
like this:</p>

<div class="program"><pre>Set-Cookie id=1190872349876;
Set-Cookie id=1190872349877;
Set-Cookie id=1190872349878;
Set-Cookie id=1190872349879;
Set-Cookie id=1190872349880;</pre></div>

<p>For most people, this was never a problem.  However, for a wily cracker,
this is an opportunity.  All the cracker had to do was change her id up or
down a digit or two and hijack someone else's session.  The server has no other
valid way of identifying you.  Sure, they could identify your browser and your
operating system (amongst other things), but that information is easily
spoofed.</p>

<p><strong>The fix:</strong>Let each id contain long strings of
random digits; this makes them impossible to deduce from any patterns.</p>

<p>Anecdote 2:  A certain teenager had a free account on a popular
blogging site and had spent a lot of time writing about how
how her parents don't understand her, and other typical teenager stuff.
Her parents found the journal, whereupon they forced her to delete it.
</p>

<p>How did they find out about the journal?  She had been pretty careful to clear
the browser cache and history.  She neglected, however, to clear the cookies.
The parents were able to determine the web site, since cookies always identify
the site they're associated with.
This mere fact would have been innocent enough... but there was
one little problem:  the cookie (in this case) also stored her username!
This led the parents right to her journal.
</p><p><strong>The fix:</strong>
<em>Don't store identifying information in cookies!</em></p>

<p>Anecdote 3:  This is a doozy.</p>

<p>Given how insecure the web tends to be, one can be excused for being
reluctant to do business over the web.  But one can also be excused for
taking advantage of the convenience of conducting business this way, such as
paying a credit card bill on line.  An on-line credit card user decided to
inspect the information stored in the cookie from the billing site.
Here's what it contained:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The name of the credit card company</li>
  <li>The web site name (of course)</li>
  <li>The user's username on the site</li>
  <li>The user's first and last name as it appeared on the card</li>
  <li>The email address used to register with the site</li>
  <li>The date on which the user last logged into the site</li>
  <li><strong>The credit card number</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The user's personal identification number (PIN)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This is absolutely horrifying.  Anyone sniffing that user's traffic could have had a
field day with this information.  Of course, if someone has access to your
computer (either by being physically present, cracking it, or running some sort
of spyware on it), they could still potentially get this information.  The user immediately
sent an email to the bank alerting them to this issue.  A couple of months
later, the bank sent an apology and a note of thanks for alerting them to the issue, which
they had subsequently fixed. They also sent a free toaster.
</p>

<p><strong>The fix:</strong>  Don't do business with idiots like that, and never,
ever send sensitive information via a cookie.</p>

<h2>Programming cookies.</h2>

<p>
CGI.pm greatly simplies programming for cookies.
First, let's create a simple web form.</p><p>

</p><div class="program"><pre>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Cookie test&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Cookie tracking&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;form method="post"&gt;
      &lt;input type="text"   name="my_name" value="Enter your name" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;input type="submit" name="save"    value="Save your name" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;input type="submit" name="delete"  value="Delete your name" /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre></div>

<p>This should create a form similar to the following:</p>

<div class="html_output"><h1>Cookie tracking</h1>
  <input name="my_name" value="Enter your name" type="text"><br>
  <input name="save" value="Save your name" type="submit"><br>
  <input name="delete" value="Delete your name" type="submit"></div>

<p>But now that we have the form, how do we save the sessions securely?  You
don't want to plow blindly ahead and at this point, we haven't learned anything
about databases or how to store the user's information safely in a file.
Further, how we do we create secure session IDs?  Well, fortunately most of
this is not a serious problem because
<a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node=mod://CGI::Session">CGI::Session</a> handles
most of this for us transparently.  The implementation we will use will
actually use a file to store the data, but you can also use DB_File or a proper
database if you wish.  Read the docs for more information.</p>

<p>The following script is complete.  You can drop this into your web server's
<tt>cgi-bin/</tt> directory or equivalent and it should run just fine, with the
possibility that you'll have to change the shebang line.</p>

<div class="program"><pre><tt>#!/usr/local/bin/perl -T
use strict;
use warnings;
use CGI;
use CGI::Session;
use HTML::Entities;
use File::Spec;

use constant DEFAULT =&gt; 'Enter your name';

my $cgi     = CGI-&gt;new;
my $session = CGI::Session-&gt;new(
    "driver:File",
    $cgi,
    { Directory =&gt; File::Spec-&gt;tmpdir }
);
$session-&gt;expire('+1h'); # this is for security!

my $cookie = $cgi-&gt;cookie(
    -name    =&gt; 'CGISESSID',
    -value   =&gt; $session-&gt;id,
    -expires =&gt; '+1h',
);

if ($cgi-&gt;param('delete')) {
    $cgi-&gt;param(name =&gt; DEFAULT);
    $session-&gt;delete; undef);
}
my $name = $cgi-&gt;param('name');
if (! $name || DEFAULT eq $name) {
    $name = $session-&gt;param('name');
}
$session-&gt;param(name =&gt; $name);

my $greeting = $name
    ? $cgi-&gt;p("Hello, ", encode_entities($name))
    : '';

print $cgi-&gt;header(-cookie =&gt; $cookie),
      $cgi-&gt;start_html(-title =&gt; 'Cookie test'),
      $cgi-&gt;h1("Cookie tracking"),
      $greeting,
      $cgi-&gt;start_form,
      $cgi-&gt;textfield(
        -name    =&gt; 'name',
        -default =&gt; DEFAULT,
      ),
      $cgi-&gt;br,
      $cgi-&gt;submit(
        -name  =&gt; 'save',
        -value =&gt; 'Save your name'
      ),
      $cgi-&gt;br,
      $cgi-&gt;submit(
        -name  =&gt; 'delete',
        -value =&gt; 'Delete your name',
      ),
      $cgi-&gt;end_form,
      $cgi-&gt;p('session name: ',encode_entities($session-&gt;param('name'))),
      $cgi-&gt;p('session id: ',$session-&gt;id),
      $cgi-&gt;end_html;</tt></pre></div>
